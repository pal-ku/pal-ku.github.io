## Integrated Photonics Design (ELEC 438/538)

Design, simulation, and optimization of integrated photonics structures; the notion of fabless silicon photonics; metal and dielectric waveguides; planar waveguide modes; coupled mode theory; integrated passive couplers and splitters; Mach-Zehnder Interferometers, ring and disk resonators; adiabatic couplers; Bragg gratings; grating and edge couplers; photonic crystal waveguides and structures; principles of integrated modulator and detector operation; fabrication-dependent design considerations; use of transfer matrix, eigenmode expansion, and finite difference time-domain simulation techniques throughout the semester; design oriented and simulation based assignments and term project.

**Prerequisites:** ELEC 421 or ELEC 429 or equivalent introductory optics course. ELEC 206 or PHYS 302 recommended but not required.

## Introduction to Optics (ELEC 429/529)

Fundamentals of optics and applications of the optical technology, including explanation of the operation of various optical instruments and understanding everyday optics phenomena, such as colors of the sky at different times of the day, rainbows, optics of the eye, principles of compact discs (CD), principles of holography, principles of fiber optic communications, etc. The course will be supplemented with lab demonstrations and project assignments that require running simulations in MATLAB or Python.

**Prerequisites:** ELEC 206 recommended but not required.

## Circuits (ELEC 202)

Basic concepts of DC and AC circuits, including basic laws, methods of analysis, circuit theorems, operational amplifiers, capacitors and inductors, and first-order circuits. The course also covers sinusoids and phasors, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, AC power analysis, magnetically coupled circuits, applications of the Laplace transform, frequency response, and Bode plots.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 106 and MATH 107.

## Probability and Random Variables (ENGR 200)

Probability models and uncertainty in real-world phenomena; conditional probability, Bayes' rule, independence and conditional independence; discrete, continuous and mixed random variables; expectations, correlations, and covariance; weak law of large numbers and central limit theorem; Bayesian inference and (linear) least mean squares estimation.

**Prerequisites:** MATH 203.
