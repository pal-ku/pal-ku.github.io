PAL members are heading to San Francisco for **SPIE Photonics West 2026**! 

We are excited to share our latest breakthroughs in integrated photonics and optical computing. This year, we have three oral presentations and two posters covering
- **Design Rule-Compliant Inverse Design**: Using deep generative networks for fabrication-compatible devices
- **AI-Driven Optimization**: Transformer-based surrogate simulator models complex photonic architectures
- **Thermally Reconfigurable Devices**: Novel reconfigurable splitters and adaptive photonic circuits
- **Random Deep Photonic Processors**: High-throughput optical inference with cascaded MZI arrays
- **Photonic Imitation Learning**: Deep photonic agentic networks for control tasks

Our work at this conference focuses on enabling arbitrary optical capabilities through deep photonic network architectures and AI-enabled devices. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
