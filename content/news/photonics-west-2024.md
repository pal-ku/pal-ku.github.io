PAL members will have a number of presentations at **Photonics West** this week! We have four oral presentations throughout the week, and also several posters on Wednesday by current and former team members. We look forward to seeing you there.

Most of our work at this conference focuses on demonstrations of photonic design regimes for arbitrary optical capabilities using deep photonic network architectures and AI-enabled devices.
