We are pleased to announce that **Bahrem Serhat Danis** and **Ujal Rzayev** have joined the Photonic Architecture Lab. Their addition brings new energy and perspectives to our ongoing research in integrated photonics and computational photonic systems. We are excited to have them on board and look forward to the advancements their work will bring.

**Bahrem Serhat Danis** will focus on research at the intersection of photonic networks and neuromorphic computing. His work aims to explore emerging architectures that leverage the unique capabilities of photonic systems for information processing. He will also contribute to the development of more effective strategies for inverse design.

**Ujal Rzayev** will work on advancing the field of silicon photonics, with a particular emphasis on accelerating inverse design methodologies. His research will contribute to the development of scalable and computationally efficient design frameworks that can enhance the performance and manufacturability of silicon-based photonic components. In addition, he will be working on photonic architectures for different applications and neuromorphic computing, expanding the impact of his work toward next-generation computing and communication systems.
