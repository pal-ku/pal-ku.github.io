## Biography

Emir Salih Magden is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Koc University, where he leads the Photonic Architecture Laboratories (PAL). Prior to joining Koc, he received his Ph.D. and S.M. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and his B.S. degree from Tufts University. His research focuses on integrated nanophotonic design, optical machine learning frameworks, and high-performance photonic computational infrastructure.

His group develops next-generation photonic architectures that combine physics-driven design and learning methods to deliver broadband, fabrication-robust, and scalable on-chip optical functionality. The work spans fundamental device concepts, ultra-fast optimization frameworks, and design pipelines aimed at applications in communications, sensing, and optical information processing. His work has been recognized with the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship, TUBITAK 2247-D National Young Leaders Research Award, the Turkish Academy of Sciences Young Scientist Award (TUBA-GEBIP), the Science Academy Young Scientist Award (BAGEP). He is a member of Optica, SPIE, and IEEE.
