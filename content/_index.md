Photonic Architecture Laboratories is a part of the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Koç University, located in İstanbul, Turkey, and led by Assistant Professor **Emir Salih Mağden**.

Our interdisciplinary research focuses on novel integrated optical functionality enabled by creative device design, innovative material solutions, and system-level integration, at the intersection of electrical engineering, applied physics, machine learning, and materials science. Similar to an architect designing for functionality for various needs of the professional, personal, or commercial work-space, we at **Photonic Architecture Laboratories** design, fabricate, and test structures and systems for manipulating light at the scale of billionths of a meter. This allows us to dictate the flow of light for many applications including communications, sensing, computation, data handling, and spectroscopy.
