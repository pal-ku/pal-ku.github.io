Academic and technical development are the most important driving forces behind innovative, creative research, and are the top priority in Photonic Architecture Laboratories.  All members of our lab have full access to the necessary resources when they need help. That is why Prof. Magden holds a detailed personal meeting with every student at least once a week, as well as group meetings. More meetings are available by appointment when needed, by contacting Prof. Magden.
