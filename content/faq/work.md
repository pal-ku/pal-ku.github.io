Depending on your prior experience, you will spend your first few months learning the basic design and simulation tools in silicon photonics using our lab’s guide. You will then be working on a small project or a relatively small part of a larger project. As you become more experienced and independent, you will have the opportunity to more significantly contribute to our existing projects, and even possibly work on brand new projects that you come up with.
