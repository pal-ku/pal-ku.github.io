Monthly stipends and tuition for full time graduate student members of the lab will be supported either by our lab’s research grants, the [Graduate School of Sciences and Engineering](https://gsse.ku.edu.tr/en/), or by their own [TUBITAK fellowships](https://tubitak.gov.tr/tr/burslar). Additionally, for all funded full-time graduate students in thesis programs, Koç University also graciously provides free housing, private health insurance, travel awards, monthly prepaid cards for lunches, and a new laptop at the beginning of their appointment.
